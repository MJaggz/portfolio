    <section id="about">
        <h2>About</h2>
<p>Hello! I'm Mohamed Jama, a 20-year-old Computer Science student at The Ohio State University, with a minor in Business. I am passionate about technology and its potential to solve real-world problems. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in software development, algorithms, and data structures, as well as a keen understanding of business principles.</p>

<p>I currently reside in Hilliard, Ohio, which has provided me with a vibrant and supportive community. Beyond my studies, I enjoy expanding my knowledge through reading, immersing myself in different worlds through movies, and challenging myself with video games. I also value the time I spend with family and friends, as they are my greatest support system.</p>
            
<p>As I look forward to my professional career, I am eager to apply my skills in software development and business in a dynamic and innovative environment. I am particularly interested in opportunities that allow me to work on impactful projects, collaborate with diverse teams, and continuously learn and grow.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>Here are some of my projects that I have worked on over the years. You can find more on my GitHub:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To-Do-list App: A GUI application that keeps track of tasks while also clearing completed tasks.</li>
            <li>Weather Forecast App: A GUI application that leverages an open-source API to retrieve and display the weather information for a specified city. The app provides the temperature in both Kelvin and Fahrenheit, along with a short description of the current weather conditions.</li>
            <li>Automated Cat Feeder: Collaborated in a team to design an automated cat feeder powered by an Arduino Mega 2560. The feeder utilizes a load sensor and an LCD screen to accurately measure and display the weight, ensuring precise dispensing of the required amount of food. For more information on this project, check my LinkedIn.</li>
            <li>Crypto Utilities: Secure communication on the internet, such as in e-commmerce, relies on public-key crypyography while also exploring the RSA algorithm. </li>
            <li>String Reassembly: A Java project that processes string fragments and employs various techniques to reassemble overlapping segments, similar to methods used in genomic research.</li>
